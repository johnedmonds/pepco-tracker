<p>
	<a href="http://pepcotracker.com">Pepco Tracker</a> exists to track
	Pepco's progress as they strive to enhance their reliability. Our goal
	is to make the data we gather freely available to everyone with an
	interest. All our statistics come from <a
		href="http://www.pepco.com/home/emergency/maps/stormcenter/">Pepco's
		Storm Center</a> web site. These statistics include how many customers are
	out and where the outages are occurring.
</p>
<p>
	We believe in openness and therefore, we share not only the data we
	have gathered, but also our methods of gathering data. You can find the
	source code for this site as well as our statistics-gathering tool at <a
		href="https://github.com/johnedmonds/pepco-tracker">GitHub</a>.
