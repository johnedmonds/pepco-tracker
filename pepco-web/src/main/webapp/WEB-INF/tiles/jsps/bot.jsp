    Hi. I'm Pepco Tracker Bot.  I'm a bot that periodically visits Pepco's website and automatically gathers crucial reliability information.
    As I notice new outages or updates to existing outages, I like to tweet about them on Twitter.
    You can keep up with all the outages going on by following me on Twitter.  <a href="https://twitter.com/PepcoTrackerBot" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @PepcoTrackerBot</a><script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs");</script>
</p>

    Feel free to travel around this site to see all the data I've gathered.
    On this site, not only can you see all the current outages, but you can also peek into the past to see how Pepco's reliability has changed (or stayed the same) over time.
